# BFS-Matlab
This is a shortest path finding algorithm using Breadth-First Search. 

There are three maps provided as a .txt file:
map_1, map_8 and map1

The three files were provided, and the purpose of these files are to visualise the map:
- map_convert.m
- plotmap.m
- viewmap.m

To run the script, run the RUNME.m file and change the inputs to switch between maps and the start/end co-ordinates
